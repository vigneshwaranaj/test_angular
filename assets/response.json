The Lipper Mid-Cap Core Funds Category Averageii returned 3.17% over the same time frame.\n                                                               \nPerformance Snapshot as of April 30, 2023 (unaudited)\n(excluding sales charges)                              6 months\nClearBridge Mid Cap Fund:                                      \nClass 11                                               1.10%   \nClass A                                                0.95%   \nClass C                                                0.57%   \nClass R                                                0.83%   \nClass I                                                1.12%   \nClass IS                                               1.16%   \nRussell Midcap Index                                   3.80%   \nLipper Mid-Cap Core Funds Category Average             3.17%   \n\n\nThe performance shown represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown above. Principal value and investment returns will fluctuate and investors shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. To obtain performance data current to the most recent month-end, please visit our website at www.franklintempleton.com.\n\nAll share class returns assume the reinvestment of all distributions, including returns of capital, if any, at net asset value and the deduction of all Fund expenses. Returns have not been adjusted to include sales charges that may apply or the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions. If sales charges were reflected, the performance quoted would be lower. Performance figures for periods shorter than one year represent cumulative figures and are not annualized.\n\nFund performance figures reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which the performance would have been lower.\n                                           \nTotal Annual Operating Expenses (unaudited)\n\n\nAs of the Funds current prospectus dated March 1, 2023, the gross total annual fund operating expense ratios for Class 1, Class A, Class C, Class R, Class I and Class IS shares were 0.83%, 1.15%, 1.88%, 1.46%, 0.87% and 0.77%, respectively.\n\nActual expenses may be higher. For example, expenses may be higher than those shown if average net assets decrease. Net assets are more likely to decrease and Fund expense ratios are more likely to increase when markets are volatile.\n\nAs a result of expense limitation arrangements, the ratio of total annual fund operating expenses, other than interest, brokerage commissions, taxes, extraordinary expenses and acquired fund fees and expenses, to average net assets will not exceed 1.20% for Class A shares, 1.95% for Class C\n1 Class 1 shares of the Fund are closed to all purchases or incoming exchanges. Investors owning Class 1 shares may continue to maintain their then-current Class 1 shares, but are no longer permitted to add to their Class 1 share positions, except through dividend reinvestment.\n                             \nClearBridge Mid Cap Fund  III\n\nPerformance review (contd)\nshares, 1.45% for Class R shares, 0.85% for Class I shares and 0.75% for Class IS shares. In addition, the ratio of total annual fund operating expenses for Class 1 shares will not exceed the ratio of total annual fund operating expenses for Class A shares and the ratio of total annual fund operating expenses for Class IS shares will not exceed the ratio of total annual fund operating expense for Class I shares. Total annual fund operating expenses, after waiving fees and/or reimbursing expenses, exceed the expense limitation (expense cap) for Class R, Class I and Class IS shares as a result of acquired fund fees and expenses. These expense limitation arrangements cannot be terminated prior to December 31, 2024 without the Board of Trustees consent. In addition, the manager has agreed to waive the Funds management fee to an extent sufficient to offset the net management fee payable in connection with any investment in an affiliated money market fund. This management fee waiver is not subject to the recapture provision discussed below.\n\nThe manager is permitted to recapture amounts waived and/or reimbursed to a class during the same fiscal year if the class total annual fund operating expenses have fallen to a level below the expense cap in effect at the time the fees were earned or the expenses incurred. In no case will the manager recapture any amount that would result, on any particular business day of the Fund, in the class total annual fund operating expenses exceeding the expense cap or any other lower limit then in effect.\n\nAs always, thank you for your confidence in our stewardship of your assets.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJane Trust, CFA\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nMay 31, 2023\n\nRISKS: The Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to market and price fluctuations. Mid-cap stocks may be more volatile than large-cap stocks. International investments are subject to special risks, including currency fluctuations and social, economic and political uncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. Emerging market countries tend to have economic, political and legal systems that are less developed and are less stable than those of more developed countries. The Fund may use derivatives, such as options, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. The market values of securities or other assets will fluctuate, sometimes sharply and unpredictably, due to changes in general market conditions, overall economic trends or events, governmental actions or intervention, actions taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve or foreign central banks, market disruptions caused by trade disputes or other factors, political developments, armed conflicts, economic sanctions and countermeasures in response to sanctions, major cybersecurity events, investor sentiment, the global and domestic effects of a pandemic, and other factors that may or may not be related to\n                              \nIV    ClearBridge Mid Cap Fund\n\nthe issuer of the security or other asset. Please see the Funds prospectus for a more complete discussion of these and other risks and the Funds investment strategies.\n\nAll investments are subject to risk including the possible loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All index performance reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes. Please note that an investor cannot invest directly in an index.\ni The Russell Midcap Index measures the performance of the mid-cap segment of the US equity universe. The Russell Midcap Index is a subset of the Russell 1000 Index. It includes approximately 800 of the smallest securities based on a combination of their market cap and current index membership. The Russell Midcap Index represents approximately 27% of the total market capitalization of the Russell 1000 companies. The Russell 1000 Index represents approximately 93% of the U.S. equity market.\nii Lipper, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Refinitiv, provides independent insight on global collective investments. Returns are based on the six-month period ended April 30, 2023, including the reinvestment of all distributions, including returns of capital, if any, calculated among the 375 funds in the Funds Lipper category, and excluding sales charges, if any.\n                             \nClearBridge Mid Cap Fund    V\n\nFund at a glance (unaudited)\nInvestment breakdown (%) as a percent of total investments\n\n The bar graph above represents the composition of the Funds investments as of April 30, 2023 and October 31, 2022. The Fund is actively managed. As a result, the composition of the Funds investments is subject to change at any time.\n                                                     \nClearBridge Mid Cap Fund 2023 Semi-Annual Report    1\n\nFund expenses (unaudited)\nExample\n\nAs a shareholder of the Fund, you may incur two types of costs: (1) transaction costs, including front-end and back-end sales charges (loads) on purchase payments; and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees; service and/or distribution (12b-1) fees; and other Fund expenses. This example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.\n\nThis example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested on November 1, 2022 and held for the six months ended April 30, 2023.\n\nActual expenses\n\nThe table below titled Based on actual total return provides information about actual account values and actual expenses. You may use the information provided in this table, together with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period. To estimate the expenses you paid on your account, divide your ending account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600 ending account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number under the heading entitled Expenses Paid During the Period.\n\n\nHypothetical example for comparison purposes\n\nThe table below titled Based on hypothetical total return provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5.00% per year before expenses, which is not the Funds actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. You may use the information provided in this table to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the Fund and other funds. To do so, compare the 5.00% hypothetical example relating to the Fund with the 5.00% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds.\n\nPlease note that the expenses shown in the table below are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as front-end or back-end sales charges (loads). Therefore, the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds. In addition, if these transaction costs were included, your costs would have been higher.\n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                           \nBased on actual total return1                           Based on hypothetical total return1\n                                  Actual                                                                 Expenses                                                              Expenses\n                               Total Return                                                                Paid                                                                  Paid  \n                                 Without     Beginning                Ending                 Annualized   During               Hypothetical  Beginning   Ending    Annualized   During \n                                  Sales       Account                 Account                 Expense      the                  Annualized    Account    Account    Expense      the   \n                                 Charge2       Value                   Value                   Ratio     Period3               Total Return    Value      Value      Ratio     Period3 \nClass 1                        1.10%         $1,000.00  $1,011.00                            0.83%       $4.14       Class 1   5.00%         $1,000.00  $1,020.68  0.83%       $4.16   \nClass A                        0.95          1,000.00   1,009.50                             1.16        5.78        Class A   5.00          1,000.00   1,019.04   1.16        5.81    \nClass C                        0.57          1,000.00   1,005.70                             1.89        9.40        Class C   5.00          1,000.00   1,015.42   1.89        9.44    \nClass R                        0.83          1,000.00   1,008.30                             1.45        7.22        Class R   5.00          1,000.00   1,017.60   1.45        7.25    \nClass I                        1.12          1,000.00   1,011.20                             0.85        4.24        Class I   5.00          1,000.00   1,020.58   0.85        4.26    \nClass IS                       1.16          1,000.00   1,011.60                             0.75        3.74        Class IS  5.00          1,000.00   1,021.08   0.75        3.76    \n\n                                                     \n2    ClearBridge Mid Cap Fund 2023 Semi-Annual Report\n\n1 For the six months ended April 30, 2023.\n2 Assumes the reinvestment of all distributions, including returns of capital, if any, at net asset value and does not reflect the deduction of the applicable sales charge with respect to Class A shares or the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) with respect to Class C shares. Total return is not annualized, as it may not be representative of the total return for the year. Performance figures may reflect compensating balance arrangements, fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. In the absence of compensating balance arrangements, fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, the total return would have been lower. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n3 Expenses (net of compensating balance arrangements, fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements) are equal to each class respective annualized expense ratio multiplied by the average account value over the period, multiplied by the number of days in the most recent fiscal half-year (181), then divided by 365.\n

In addition, the manager has agreed to waive the Funds management fee to an extent sufficient to offset the net management fee payable in connection with any investment in an affiliated money market fund.\n6 Reflects fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements.\n7 Excludes securities delivered as a result of a redemption in-kind.\nSee Notes to Financial Statements.\n                                                      \n18    ClearBridge Mid Cap Fund 2023 Semi-Annual Report\n\nNotes to financial statements (unaudited)\n1. Organization and significant accounting policies\nClearBridge Mid Cap Fund (the Fund) is a separate diversified investment series of Legg Mason Partners Investment Trust (the Trust). The Trust, a Maryland statutory trust, is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), as an open-end management investment company.\n\nThe Fund follows the accounting and reporting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services Investment Companies (ASC 946). The following are significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund and are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), including, but not limited to, ASC 946. Estimates and assumptions are required to be made regarding assets, liabilities and changes in net assets resulting from operations when financial statements are prepared. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ. Subsequent events have been evaluated through the date the financial statements were issued.\n\n(a) Investment valuation. Equity securities for which market quotations are available are valued at the last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they trade. The valuations for fixed income securities (which may include, but are not limited to, corporate, government, municipal, mortgage-backed, collateralized mortgage obligations and asset-backed securities) and certain derivative instruments are typically the prices supplied by independent third party pricing services, which may use market prices or broker/dealer quotations or a variety of valuation techniques and methodologies. The independent third party pricing services typically use inputs that are observable such as issuer details, interest rates, yield curves, prepayment speeds, credit risks/spreads, default rates and quoted prices for similar securities. Investments in open-end funds are valued at the closing net asset value per share of each fund on the day of valuation. When the Fund holds securities or other assets that are denominated in a foreign currency, the Fund will normally use the currency exchange rates as of 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time). If independent third party pricing services are unable to supply prices for a portfolio investment, or if the prices supplied are deemed by the manager to be unreliable, the market price may be determined by the manager using quotations from one or more broker/dealers or at the transaction price if the security has recently been purchased and no value has yet been obtained from a pricing service or pricing broker. When reliable prices are not readily available, such as when the value of a security has been significantly affected by events after the close of the exchange or market on which the security is principally traded, but before the Fund calculates its net asset value, the Fund values these securities as determined in accordance with procedures approved by the Funds Board of Trustees.\n\nPursuant to policies adopted by the Board of Trustees, the Funds manager has been designated as the valuation designee and is responsible for the oversight of the daily valuation process. The Funds manager is assisted by the Global Fund Valuation Committee (the Valuation Committee). The Valuation Committee is responsible for making fair value\n                                                      \nClearBridge Mid Cap Fund 2023 Semi-Annual Report    19\n\nNotes to financial statements (unaudited) (contd)\ndeterminations, evaluating the effectiveness of the Funds pricing policies, and reporting to the Funds manager and the Board of Trustees. When determining the reliability of third party pricing information for investments owned by the Fund, the Valuation Committee, among other things, conducts due diligence reviews of pricing vendors, monitors the daily change in prices and reviews transactions among market participants.\n\nThe Valuation Committee will consider pricing methodologies it deems relevant and appropriate when making fair value determinations. Examples of possible methodologies include, but are not limited to, multiple of earnings; discount from market of a similar freely traded security; discounted cash-flow analysis; book value or a multiple thereof; risk premium/yield analysis; yield to maturity; and/or fundamental investment analysis. The Valuation Committee will also consider factors it deems relevant and appropriate in light of the facts and circumstances. Examples of possible factors include, but are not limited to, the type of security; the issuers financial statements; the purchase price of the security; the discount from market value of unrestricted securities of the same class at the time of purchase; analysts research and observations from financial institutions; information regarding any transactions or offers with respect to the security; the existence of merger proposals or tender offers affecting the security; the price and extent of public trading in similar securities of the issuer or comparable companies; and the existence of a shelf registration for restricted securities.\n\nFor each portfolio security that has been fair valued pursuant to the policies adopted by the Board of Trustees, the fair value price is compared against the last available and next available market quotations. The Valuation Committee reviews the results of such back testing monthly and fair valuation occurrences are reported to the Board of Trustees quarterly.\n\nThe Fund uses valuation techniques to measure fair value that are consistent with the market approach and/or income approach, depending on the type of security and the particular circumstance. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable securities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to discount estimated future cash flows to present value.\n\nGAAP establishes a disclosure hierarchy that categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to value assets and liabilities at measurement date. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below:\n Level 1  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical investments\n Level 2  other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)\n Level 3  significant unobservable inputs (including the Funds own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)\n                                                      \n20    ClearBridge Mid Cap Fund 2023 Semi-Annual Report\n\nThe inputs or methodologies used to value securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.\n\nThe following is a summary of the inputs used in valuing the Funds assets carried at fair value:\n                                                                                        \n        ASSETS         \n                                                            Significant                 \n                                         Other Significant  Unobservable                \n                         Quoted Prices   Observable Inputs     Inputs                   \nDescription                (Level 1)         (Level 2)       (Level 3)        Total     \nCommon Stocks           $1,854,602,202                                 $1,854,602,202\nShort-Term Investments  55,881,494                                     55,881,494    \nTotal Investments        $1,910,483,696                                 $1,910,483,696\n\n See Schedule of Investments for additional detailed categorizations.\n\n(b) Foreign currency translation. Investment securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollar amounts based upon prevailing exchange rates on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of investment securities and income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollar amounts based upon prevailing exchange rates on the respective dates of such transactions.\n\nThe Fund does not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.\n\nNet realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign currencies, including gains and losses on forward foreign currency contracts, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement dates on securities transactions, and the difference between the amounts of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes recorded on the Funds books and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses arise from changes in the values of assets and liabilities, other than investments in securities, on the date of valuation, resulting from changes in exchange rates.\n\nForeign security and currency transactions may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with those of U.S. dollar denominated transactions as a result of, among other factors, the possibility of lower levels of governmental supervision and regulation of foreign securities markets and the possibility of political or economic instability.\n\n(c) Foreign investment risks. The Funds investments in foreign securities may involve risks not present in domestic investments. Since securities may be denominated in foreign currencies, may require settlement in foreign currencies or may pay interest or dividends in foreign currencies, changes in the relationship of these foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar\n                                                      \nClearBridge Mid Cap Fund 2023 Semi-Annual Report    21\n\nNotes to financial statements (unaudited) (contd)\ncan significantly affect the value of the investments and earnings of the Fund. Foreign investments may also subject the Fund to foreign government exchange restrictions, expropriation, taxation or other political, social or economic developments, all of which affect the market and/or credit risk of the investments.\n\n(d) Security transactions and investment income. Security transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. Interest income (including interest income from payment-in-kind securities), adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on the accrual basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date for dividends received in cash and/or securities. Foreign dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date or as soon as practicable after the Fund determines the existence of a dividend declaration after exercising reasonable due diligence. The cost of investments sold is determined by use of the specific identification method. To the extent any issuer defaults or a credit event occurs that impacts the issuer, the Fund may halt any additional interest income accruals and consider the realizability of interest accrued up to the date of default or credit event.\n\n(e) REIT distributions. The character of distributions received from Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) held by the Fund is generally comprised of net investment income, capital gains, and return of capital. It is the policy of the Fund to estimate the character of distributions received from underlying REITs based on historical data provided by the REITs. After each calendar year end, REITs report the actual tax character of these distributions. Differences between the estimated and actual amounts reported by the REITs are reflected in the Funds records in the year in which they are reported by the REITs by adjusting related investment cost basis, capital gains and income, as necessary.\n\n(f) Distributions to shareholders. Distributions from net investment income and distributions of net realized gains, if any, are declared at least annually. Distributions to shareholders of the Fund are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.\n\n(g) Share class accounting. Investment income, common expenses and realized/ unrealized gains (losses) on investments are allocated to the various classes of the Fund on the basis of daily net assets of each class. Fees relating to a specific class are charged directly to that share class.\n\n(h) Compensating balance arrangements. The Fund has an arrangement with its custodian bank whereby a portion of the custodians fees is paid indirectly by credits earned on the Funds cash on deposit with the bank.\n\n(i) Federal and other taxes. It is the Funds policy to comply with the federal income and excise tax requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code), as amended, applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, the Fund intends to distribute its taxable income and net realized gains, if any, to shareholders in accordance with timing requirements imposed by the Code. Therefore, no federal or state income tax provision is required in the Funds financial statements.\n                                                      \n22    ClearBridge Mid Cap Fund 2023 Semi-Annual Report\n\nManagement has analyzed the Funds tax positions taken on income tax returns for all open tax years and has concluded that as of October 31, 2022, no provision for income tax is required in the Funds financial statements. The Funds federal and state income and federal excise tax returns for tax years for which the applicable statutes of limitations have not expired are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state departments of revenue.\n\n(j) Reclassification. GAAP requires that certain components of net assets be reclassified to reflect permanent differences between financial and tax reporting. These reclassifications have no effect on net assets or net asset value per share.\n\n2. Investment management agreement and other transactions with affiliates\nLegg Mason Partners Fund Advisor, LLC (LMPFA) is the Funds investment manager and ClearBridge Investments, LLC (ClearBridge) is the Funds subadviser. Western Asset Management Company, LLC (Western Asset) manages the portion of the Funds cash and short-term instruments allocated to it. LMPFA, ClearBridge and Western Asset are indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Franklin Resources, Inc. (Franklin Resources).\n\nUnder the investment management agreement, the Fund pays an investment management fee, calculated daily and paid monthly, in accordance with the following breakpoint schedule:\n                                     \nAverage Daily Net Assets  Annual Rate\nFirst $1 billion          0.750%     \nNext $1 billion           0.700      \nNext $3 billion           0.650      \nNext $5 billion           0.600      \nOver $10 billion          0.550      \n\n\nLMPFA provides administrative and certain oversight services to the Fund. LMPFA delegates to the subadviser the day-to-day portfolio management of the Fund, except for the management of the portion of the Funds cash and short-term instruments allocated to Western Asset. For its services, LMPFA pays ClearBridge a fee monthly, at an annual rate equal to 70% of the net management fee it receives from the Fund. For Western Assets services to the Fund, LMPFA pays Western Asset monthly 0.02% of the portion of the Funds average daily net assets that are allocated to Western Asset by LMPFA.\n\nAs a result of expense limitation arrangements between the Fund and LMPFA, the ratio of total annual fund operating expenses, other than interest, brokerage commissions, taxes, extraordinary expenses and acquired fund fees and expenses, to average net assets of Class A, Class C, Class R, Class I and Class IS shares did not exceed 1.20%, 1.95%, 1.45%, 0.85% and 0.75%, respectively. In addition, the ratio of total annual fund operating expenses for Class IS shares did not exceed the ratio of total annual fund operating expenses for Class I shares and the ratio of total annual fund operating expenses for Class 1 shares did not exceed the ratio of total annual fund operating expenses for Class A shares. These expense limitation arrangements cannot be terminated prior to December 31,\n                                                      \nClearBridge Mid Cap Fund 2023 Semi-Annual Report    23\n\nNotes to financial statements (unaudited) (contd)\n2024 without the Board of Trustees consent. In addition, the manager has agreed to waive the Funds management fee to an extent sufficient to offset the net management fee payable in connection with any investment in an affiliated money market fund (the affiliated money market fund waiver). The affiliated money market fund waiver is not subject to the recapture provision discussed below.\n\nDuring the six months ended April 30, 2023, fees waived and/or expenses reimbursed amounted to $137,485, which included an affiliated money market fund waiver of $5,472.\n\nLMPFA is permitted to recapture amounts waived and/or reimbursed to a class during the same fiscal year if the class total annual fund operating expenses have fallen to a level below the expense limitation (expense cap) in effect at the time the fees were earned or the expenses incurred. In no case will LMPFA recapture any amount that would result, on any particular business day of the Fund, in the class total annual fund operating expenses exceeding the expense cap or any other lower limit then in effect.\n\nFranklin Templeton Investor Services, LLC (Investor Services) serves as the Funds shareholder servicing agent and acts as the Funds transfer agent and dividend-paying agent. Investor Services is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources. Franklin Distributors, LLC (Franklin Distributors) serves as the Funds sole and exclusive distributor. Franklin Distributors is an indirect, wholly-owned broker-dealer subsidiary of Franklin Resources.\n\nThere is a maximum initial sales charge of 5.50% for Class A shares. There is a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) of 1.00% on Class C shares, which applies if redemption occurs within 12 months from purchase payment. In certain cases, Class A shares have a 1.00% CDSC, which applies if redemption occurs within 18 months from purchase payment. This CDSC only applies to those purchases of Class A shares, which, when combined with current holdings of other shares of funds sold by Franklin Distributors, equal or exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate. These purchases do not incur an initial sales charge.\n\nFor the six months ended April 30, 2023, sales charges retained by and CDSCs paid to Franklin Distributors and its affiliates, if any, were as follows:\n                               \n               Class A  Class C\nSales charges  $80,543        \nCDSCs          364      $196   \n\n\nAll officers and one Trustee of the Trust are employees of Franklin Resources or its affiliates and do not receive compensation from the Trust.\n\n3.

Derivative instruments and hedging activities\nDuring the six months ended April 30, 2023, the Fund did not invest in derivative instruments.\n\n5. Class specific expenses, waivers and/or expense reimbursements\nThe Fund has adopted a Rule 12b-1 shareholder services and distribution plan and under that plan the Fund pays service and/or distribution fees with respect to its Class A, Class C and Class R shares calculated at the annual rate of 0.25%, 1.00% and 0.50% of the average daily net assets of each class, respectively. Service and/or distribution fees are accrued daily and paid monthly.\n\nFor the six months ended April 30, 2023, class specific expenses were as follows:\n                                           \n           Service and/or    Transfer Agent\n          Distribution Fees       Fees     \nClass 1                     $1,416        \nClass A   $1,377,693         871,648       \nClass C   90,623             12,848        \nClass R   144,375            61,586        \nClass I                     233,217       \nClass IS                    40,369        \nTotal     $1,612,691         $1,221,084    \n\n\nFor the six months ended April 30, 2023, waivers and/or expense reimbursements by class were as follows:\n                         \n          Waivers/Expense\n          Reimbursements \nClass 1   $110           \nClass A   36,421         \nClass C   594            \nClass R   5,789          \nClass I   41,886         \nClass IS  52,685         \nTotal     $137,485       \n\n                                                      \nClearBridge Mid Cap Fund 2023 Semi-Annual Report    25\n\nNotes to financial statements (unaudited) (contd)\n\n6.

Redemption facility\nThe Fund, together with other U.S. registered and foreign investment funds (collectively, the Borrowers) managed by Franklin Resources or its affiliates, is a borrower in a joint syndicated senior unsecured credit facility totaling $2.675 billion (the Global Credit Facility). The Global Credit Facility provides a source of funds to the Borrowers for temporary and emergency purposes, including the ability to meet future unanticipated or unusually large redemption requests. Unless renewed, the Global Credit Facility will terminate on February 2, 2024.\n\nUnder the terms of the Global Credit Facility, the Fund shall, in addition to interest charged on any borrowings made by the Fund and other costs incurred by the Fund, pay its share of fees and expenses incurred in connection with the implementation and maintenance of the Global Credit Facility, based upon its relative share of the aggregate net assets of all the Borrowers, including an annual commitment fee of 0.15% based upon the unused portion of the Global Credit Facility. These fees are reflected in the Statement of Operations. The Fund did not utilize the Global Credit Facility during the six months ended April 30, 2023.\n\n10. Recent accounting pronouncement\n\nIn June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)  Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions. The amendments in the ASU clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, should not be considered in measuring fair value. The ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023, with the option of early adoption. Management has reviewed the requirements and believes that the adoption of the ASU will not have a material impact on the financial statements.\n                                                      \n28    ClearBridge Mid Cap Fund 2023 Semi-Annual Report\n\n\nClearBridge\nMid Cap Fund\nTrustees\nPaul R.

Past performance is no guarantee of future\nresults and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown above.\nPrincipal value and investment returns will fluctuate and investors’ shares, when redeemed, may be\nworth more or less than their original cost. To obtain performance data current to the most recent\nmonth-end, please visit our website at www.franklintempleton.com.\nAll share class returns assume the reinvestment of all distributions, including returns of capital, if\nany, at net asset value and the deduction of all Fund expenses. Returns have not been adjusted to\ninclude sales charges that may apply or the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on\nFund distributions. If sales charges were reflected, the performance quoted would be lower.\nPerformance figures for periods shorter than one year represent cumulative figures and are not\nannualized.\nFund performance figures reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which the\nperformance would have been lower.\n\n    Total Annual Operating Expenses (unaudited)\n\nAs of the Fund’s current prospectus dated March 1, 2023, the gross total annual fund operating\nexpense ratios for Class 1, Class A, Class C, Class R, Class I and Class IS shares were 0.83%, 1.15%,\n1.88%, 1.46%, 0.87% and 0.77%, respectively.\nActual expenses may be higher. For example, expenses may be higher than those shown if average\nnet assets decrease. Net assets are more likely to decrease and Fund expense ratios are more\nlikely to increase when markets are volatile.\nAs a result of expense limitation arrangements, the ratio of total annual fund operating expenses,\nother than interest, brokerage commissions, taxes, extraordinary expenses and acquired fund fees\nand expenses, to average net assets will not exceed 1.20% for Class A shares, 1.95% for Class C\n1    Class 1 shares of the Fund are closed to all purchases or incoming exchanges.

In addition,\nthe ratio of total annual fund operating expenses for Class 1 shares will not exceed the ratio of total\nannual fund operating expenses for Class A shares and the ratio of total annual fund operating\nexpenses for Class IS shares will not exceed the ratio of total annual fund operating expense for\nClass I shares. Total annual fund operating expenses, after waiving fees and/or reimbursing\nexpenses, exceed the expense limitation (“expense cap”) for Class R, Class I and Class IS shares as\na result of acquired fund fees and expenses. These expense limitation arrangements cannot be\nterminated prior to December 31, 2024 without the Board of Trustees’ consent. In addition, the\nmanager has agreed to waive the Fund’s management fee to an extent sufficient to offset the net\nmanagement fee payable in connection with any investment in an affiliated money market fund.\nThis management fee waiver is not subject to the recapture provision discussed below.\nThe manager is permitted to recapture amounts waived and/or reimbursed to a class during the\nsame fiscal year if the class’ total annual fund operating expenses have fallen to a level below the\nexpense cap in effect at the time the fees were earned or the expenses incurred. In no case will the\nmanager recapture any amount that would result, on any particular business day of the Fund, in the\nclass’ total annual fund operating expenses exceeding the expense cap or any other lower limit\nthen in effect.\n\nAs always, thank you for your confidence in our stewardship of your assets.\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\nJane Trust, CFA\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nMay 31, 2023\nRISKS: The Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to market and price fluctuations.\nMid-cap stocks may be more volatile than large-cap stocks. International investments are\nsubject to special risks, including currency fluctuations and social, economic and political\nuncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets.\nEmerging market countries tend to have economic, political and legal systems that are less\ndeveloped and are less stable than those of more developed countries. The Fund may use\nderivatives, such as options, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and\nhave a potentially large impact on Fund performance. The market values of securities or other\nassets will fluctuate, sometimes sharply and unpredictably, due to changes in general market\nconditions, overall economic trends or events, governmental actions or intervention, actions\ntaken by the U.S. Federal Reserve or foreign central banks, market disruptions caused by trade\ndisputes or other factors, political developments, armed conflicts, economic sanctions and\ncountermeasures in response to sanctions, major cybersecurity events, investor sentiment, the\nglobal and domestic effects of a pandemic, and other factors that may or may not be related to\n\n\nIV     ClearBridge Mid Cap Fund\n\nPage 5\nthe issuer of the security or other asset.

Organization and significant accounting policies\nClearBridge Mid Cap Fund (the “Fund”) is a separate diversified investment series of Legg\nMason Partners Investment Trust (the “Trust”). The Trust, a Maryland statutory trust, is\nregistered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), as an\nopen-end management investment company.\nThe Fund follows the accounting and reporting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services –\nInvestment Companies (“ASC 946”). The following are significant accounting policies\nconsistently followed by the Fund and are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“GAAP”), including, but not limited to, ASC 946. Estimates and\nassumptions are required to be made regarding assets, liabilities and changes in net assets\nresulting from operations when financial statements are prepared. Changes in the economic\nenvironment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these\nestimates could cause actual results to differ. Subsequent events have been evaluated\nthrough the date the financial statements were issued.\n(a) Investment valuation. Equity securities for which market quotations are available are\nvalued at the last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary market or\nexchange on which they trade. The valuations for fixed income securities (which may\ninclude, but are not limited to, corporate, government, municipal, mortgage-backed,\ncollateralized mortgage obligations and asset-backed securities) and certain derivative\ninstruments are typically the prices supplied by independent third party pricing services,\nwhich may use market prices or broker/dealer quotations or a variety of valuation\ntechniques and methodologies. The independent third party pricing services typically use\ninputs that are observable such as issuer details, interest rates, yield curves, prepayment\nspeeds, credit risks/spreads, default rates and quoted prices for similar securities.\nInvestments in open-end funds are valued at the closing net asset value per share of each\nfund on the day of valuation. When the Fund holds securities or other assets that are\ndenominated in a foreign currency, the Fund will normally use the currency exchange rates\nas of 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time). If independent third party pricing services are unable to\nsupply prices for a portfolio investment, or if the prices supplied are deemed by the\nmanager to be unreliable, the market price may be determined by the manager using\nquotations from one or more broker/dealers or at the transaction price if the security has\nrecently been purchased and no value has yet been obtained from a pricing service or\npricing broker. When reliable prices are not readily available, such as when the value of a\nsecurity has been significantly affected by events after the close of the exchange or market\non which the security is principally traded, but before the Fund calculates its net asset\nvalue, the Fund values these securities as determined in accordance with procedures\napproved by the Fund’s Board of Trustees.\nPursuant to policies adopted by the Board of Trustees, the Fund’s manager has been\ndesignated as the valuation designee and is responsible for the oversight of the daily\nvaluation process. The Fund’s manager is assisted by the Global Fund Valuation Committee\n(the “Valuation Committee”). The Valuation Committee is responsible for making fair value\n\n                                           ClearBridge Mid Cap Fund 2023 Semi-Annual Report   19\n\nPage 26\nNotes to financial statements (unaudited) (cont’d)\n\ndeterminations, evaluating the effectiveness of the Fund’s pricing policies, and reporting to\nthe Fund’s manager and the Board of Trustees. When determining the reliability of third\nparty pricing information for investments owned by the Fund, the Valuation Committee,\namong other things, conducts due diligence reviews of pricing vendors, monitors the daily\nchange in prices and reviews transactions among market participants.\nThe Valuation Committee will consider pricing methodologies it deems relevant and\nappropriate when making fair value determinations. Examples of possible methodologies\ninclude, but are not limited to, multiple of earnings; discount from market of a similar freely\ntraded security; discounted cash-flow analysis; book value or a multiple thereof; risk\npremium/yield analysis; yield to maturity; and/or fundamental investment analysis. The\nValuation Committee will also consider factors it deems relevant and appropriate in light of\nthe facts and circumstances. Examples of possible factors include, but are not limited to,\nthe type of security; the issuer’s financial statements; the purchase price of the security; the\ndiscount from market value of unrestricted securities of the same class at the time of\npurchase; analysts’ research and observations from financial institutions; information\nregarding any transactions or offers with respect to the security; the existence of merger\nproposals or tender offers affecting the security; the price and extent of public trading in\nsimilar securities of the issuer or comparable companies; and the existence of a shelf\nregistration for restricted securities.\nFor each portfolio security that has been fair valued pursuant to the policies adopted by the\nBoard of Trustees, the fair value price is compared against the last available and next\navailable market quotations. The Valuation Committee reviews the results of such back\ntesting monthly and fair valuation occurrences are reported to the Board of Trustees\nquarterly.\nThe Fund uses valuation techniques to measure fair value that are consistent with the\nmarket approach and/or income approach, depending on the type of security and the\nparticular circumstance. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information\ngenerated by market transactions involving identical or comparable securities. The income\napproach uses valuation techniques to discount estimated future cash flows to present\nvalue.\nGAAP establishes a disclosure hierarchy that categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques\nused to value assets and liabilities at measurement date. These inputs are summarized in\nthe three broad levels listed below:\n• Level 1 — unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical investments\n• Level 2 — other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar\n  investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)\n• Level 3 — significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund’s own assumptions in\n  determining the fair value of investments)\n\n\n\n20     ClearBridge Mid Cap Fund 2023 Semi-Annual Report\n\nPage 27\nThe inputs or methodologies used to value securities are not necessarily an indication of\nthe risk associated with investing in those securities.\nThe following is a summary of the inputs used in valuing the Fund’s assets carried at fair\nvalue:\n                                                    ASSETS\n                                                                            Significant\n                                                       Other Significant   Unobservable\n                                    Quoted Prices      Observable Inputs      Inputs\nDescription                           (Level 1)            (Level 2)         (Level 3)           Total\nCommon Stocks†                     $1,854,602,202              —                —           $1,854,602,202\nShort-Term Investments†                55,881,494              —                —               55,881,494\nTotal Investments                  $1,910,483,696              —                —           $1,910,483,696\n† See Schedule of Investments for additional detailed categorizations.\n\n(b) Foreign currency translation. Investment securities and other assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollar amounts based upon\nprevailing exchange rates on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of investment\nsecurities and income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are translated\ninto U.S. dollar amounts based upon prevailing exchange rates on the respective dates of\nsuch transactions.\nThe Fund does not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from\nchanges in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations are included with the net\nrealized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.\nNet realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign currencies,\nincluding gains and losses on forward foreign currency contracts, currency gains or losses\nrealized between the trade and settlement dates on securities transactions, and the\ndifference between the amounts of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes\nrecorded on the Fund’s books and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts actually\nreceived or paid. Net unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses arise from changes in\nthe values of assets and liabilities, other than investments in securities, on the date of\nvaluation, resulting from changes in exchange rates.\nForeign security and currency transactions may involve certain considerations and risks not\ntypically associated with those of U.S. dollar denominated transactions as a result of,\namong other factors, the possibility of lower levels of governmental supervision and\nregulation of foreign securities markets and the possibility of political or economic\ninstability.\n(c) Foreign investment risks. The Fund’s investments in foreign securities may involve\nrisks not present in domestic investments. Since securities may be denominated in foreign\ncurrencies, may require settlement in foreign currencies or may pay interest or dividends in\nforeign currencies, changes in the relationship of these foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar\n\n                                                     ClearBridge Mid Cap Fund 2023 Semi-Annual Report        21\n\nPage 28\nNotes to financial statements (unaudited) (cont’d)\n\ncan significantly affect the value of the investments and earnings of the Fund. Foreign\ninvestments may also subject the Fund to foreign government exchange restrictions,\nexpropriation, taxation or other political, social or economic developments, all of which\naffect the market and/or credit risk of the investments.\n(d) Security transactions and investment income. Security transactions are accounted\nfor on a trade date basis. Interest income (including interest income from payment-in-kind\nsecurities), adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on\nthe accrual basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date for dividends\nreceived in cash and/or securities. Foreign dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend\ndate or as soon as practicable after the Fund determines the existence of a dividend\ndeclaration after exercising reasonable due diligence. The cost of investments sold is\ndetermined by use of the specific identification method. To the extent any issuer defaults or\na credit event occurs that impacts the issuer, the Fund may halt any additional interest\nincome accruals and consider the realizability of interest accrued up to the date of default\nor credit event.\n(e) REIT distributions. The character of distributions received from Real Estate Investment\nTrusts (‘‘REITs’’) held by the Fund is generally comprised of net investment income, capital\ngains, and return of capital. It is the policy of the Fund to estimate the character of\ndistributions received from underlying REITs based on historical data provided by the REITs.\nAfter each calendar year end, REITs report the actual tax character of these distributions.\nDifferences between the estimated and actual amounts reported by the REITs are reflected\nin the Fund’s records in the year in which they are reported by the REITs by adjusting related\ninvestment cost basis, capital gains and income, as necessary.\n(f) Distributions to shareholders. Distributions from net investment income and\ndistributions of net realized gains, if any, are declared at least annually. Distributions to\nshareholders of the Fund are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are determined in\naccordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.\n(g) Share class accounting. Investment income, common expenses and realized/\nunrealized gains (losses) on investments are allocated to the various classes of the Fund on\nthe basis of daily net assets of each class. Fees relating to a specific class are charged\ndirectly to that share class.\n(h) Compensating balance arrangements. The Fund has an arrangement with its\ncustodian bank whereby a portion of the custodian’s fees is paid indirectly by credits earned\non the Fund’s cash on deposit with the bank.\n(i) Federal and other taxes. It is the Fund’s policy to comply with the federal income and\nexcise tax requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), as amended,\napplicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, the Fund intends to distribute\nits taxable income and net realized gains, if any, to shareholders in accordance with timing\nrequirements imposed by the Code. Therefore, no federal or state income tax provision is\nrequired in the Fund’s financial statements.\n\n22     ClearBridge Mid Cap Fund 2023 Semi-Annual Report\n\nPage 29\nManagement has analyzed the Fund’s tax positions taken on income tax returns for all open\ntax years and has concluded that as of October 31, 2022, no provision for income tax is\nrequired in the Fund’s financial statements. The Fund’s federal and state income and federal\nexcise tax returns for tax years for which the applicable statutes of limitations have not\nexpired are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state departments\nof revenue.\n(j) Reclassification. GAAP requires that certain components of net assets be reclassified\nto reflect permanent differences between financial and tax reporting. These\nreclassifications have no effect on net assets or net asset value per share.\n2.

The Global Credit Facility provides a source of funds to the Borrowers for\ntemporary and emergency purposes, including the ability to meet future unanticipated or\nunusually large redemption requests. Unless renewed, the Global Credit Facility will\nterminate on February 2, 2024.\nUnder the terms of the Global Credit Facility, the Fund shall, in addition to interest charged\non any borrowings made by the Fund and other costs incurred by the Fund, pay its share of\nfees and expenses incurred in connection with the implementation and maintenance of the\nGlobal Credit Facility, based upon its relative share of the aggregate net assets of all the\nBorrowers, including an annual commitment fee of 0.15% based upon the unused portion of\nthe Global Credit Facility. These fees are reflected in the Statement of Operations. The Fund\ndid not utilize the Global Credit Facility during the six months ended April 30, 2023.\n10. Recent accounting pronouncement\nIn June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting\nStandards Update (ASU) No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) – Fair Value\nMeasurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions. The\namendments in the ASU clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity\nsecurity is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore,\nshould not be considered in measuring fair value. The ASU is effective for interim and\nannual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023, with the option of early\nadoption. Management has reviewed the requirements and believes that the adoption of\nthe ASU will not have a material impact on the financial statements.\n\n\n\n\n28      ClearBridge Mid Cap Fund 2023 Semi-Annual Report\n\nPage 35\n(This page intentionally left blank.)\n\nPage 36\n(This page intentionally left blank.)\n\nPage 37\nClearBridge\nMid Cap Fund\nTrustees                            Investment manager                               Transfer agent\nPaul R.
